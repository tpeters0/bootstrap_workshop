# Part 1

### Objectives
* Add some simple markup
* Link bootstrap, dependencies, and fonts
* Add our container

### Notes
* Bootstrap comes with Glyphicons, and font-awesome is completely optional
* You can use bootstrap styles with just the single css file, but we're adding its javascript components (and jQuery dependency) for some additioanl functionality that we'll cover later
