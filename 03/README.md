# Part 3

### Objectives
* Add glyphicons!
  *  `<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-music"></i>`
* Explore text classes
  * `lead`, `text-muted`, etc.

### Notes
* There's nothing special about the `<i>` element, except that it's become a semantic tag for icons (actually used to be used for italics in the old days but has adopted a new meaning over time.
