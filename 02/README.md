# Part 2

### Objectives
* Use rows/columns for scaffolding 
  * `col-md-4`
* Add visibility classes to hide/show content at specific breakpoints
  * `visible-xs-block visible-sm-block`

### Notes
* HTML5 gives us semantic tags like `section`, but it's functionally equivalent to a div
* Never nest containers
* Rows need to be in containers
